   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.
