/Applications/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/fluttertoast-8.0.9/android/src/main/kotlin/io/github/ponnamkarthik/toast/fluttertoast/MethodCallHandlerImpl.kt:50: Warning: Avoid passing null as the view root (needed to resolve layout parameters on the inflated layout's root element) [InflateParams]
                    val layout = (context.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE) as LayoutInflater).inflate(R.layout.toast_custom, null)
                                                                                                                                              ~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "InflateParams":
   When inflating a layout, avoid passing in null as the parent view, since
   otherwise any layout parameters on the root of the inflated layout will be
   ignored.

/Applications/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/fluttertoast-8.0.9/android/build.gradle:12: Warning: A newer version of com.android.tools.build:gradle than 4.1.0 is available: 7.2.2. (There is also a newer version of 4.1.ùë• available, if upgrading to 7.2.2 is difficult: 4.1.3) [AndroidGradlePluginVersion]

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/Applications/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/fluttertoast-8.0.9/android/src/main/res/drawable/toast_bg.xml:2: Warning: The resource R.drawable.toast_bg appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
<shape xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:shape="rectangle">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.

   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true.
